All information is regarding the US version, but may be aplicable to other versions as well. Parts of this document assume you have a basic understanding of c structs and coding. Basics Most numbers in this document will be in hexadecimal , or base 16. Keep this in mind while reading. All values are stored little endian. In practice, this means that when reading a value you read the bytes from right to left. For example, the address for the track table 0x08258000 would be stored in the rom as 00 80 25 08 This applies to all values. All compressed data will use LZ77 compression unless explicitly stated otherwise. Offsets are commonly used, to find the address of an offset, take the stated base pointer and add the value of the offset to it.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#super-circuit-docs","text":"Mario Kart: Super Circuit Technical documentation.
