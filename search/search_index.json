All information is regarding the US version, but may be aplicable to other versions as well. This document assume you have a decent understanding of C and hex editing. Basics Most numbers in this document will be in hexadecimal , or base 16. Keep this in mind while reading. All values are stored little endian. In practice, this means that when reading a value you read the bytes from right to left. For example, the address for the track table 0x08258000 would be stored in the rom as 00 80 25 08 This applies to all values.
