# Advanced Edit 7

**OUTDATED: See https://github.com/aplerdal/AdvancedEdit**

AdvancedEdit is a cross-platform track editor for Mario Kart: Super Circuit (GBA). It requires a mksc rom, which is not included. The editor has only been explicitly tested on the US version, but may work for other regions as well.

Advanced Edit can:
- Modify track layouts
- Change enemy AI
- Move starting positions
- Modify track props
- Change Tile behaviors
- Import and export custom tilesets
- Import SMK tracks

And hopefully it will be able to do even more in the future. 

Happy designing!
